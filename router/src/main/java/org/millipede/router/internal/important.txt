generator merapi -> osgi
listens for merapi based messages, 
converts to OSGi events and 
distributes them into the OSGi Backend

handler osgi -> merapi
listens for osgi based Events,
converts to Merapi Messages and
distributes them to the Merapi Bridge

important: there is a eventdistribution bundle which
tracks EventAdmin and let some place for Configuation the
Event flow.

Fututre: Merapi Bridge for other FrontEnd Platforms
such as Silverlight, JavaFx...

Important: org.millipede.router.Actiavtor which should initiating Communication
(EventGenerator, DLControlEventHandler) is not working properly.
Reason: not identified -> OSGi EventAdmin stop immediately when Flex request arrieves
maybee because a Thread of Merapi homes to the merapi bundle.

Workaround: Initiation in org.merapi.BridgeActivator
